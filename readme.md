# RPG Game

- Make progress through the forest with each turn, with the goal of reaching the final boss at the end.
- Each time you progress, there is a chance you'll run into a beast, which will initiate a turn based fight.
- Defeating the beast lets you progress in levels as you continue through the forest, which will be essential when fighting the final boss.
- Learn abilities when you level up, ranging from healing to offensive spells.
- Only one level is currently completed, but more will likely be added at a later date.
